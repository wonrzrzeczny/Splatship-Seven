# Splatship Seven

Steer your fragile spacecraft through dangerous environments with traps hidden at every step! Your every failure contributes to your future attempts. This game is my submission for the [Wowie Jam 3.0](https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-3 "Wowie Jam 3.0") with a theme **Failure is progress**.
